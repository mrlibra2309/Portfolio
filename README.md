**Findings**

Dashboard 1: Overall
Basic Metrics
- Number of Customers: 7.043K
- Total Revenue**: $21.37M
- Customer Lifetime Value: $2.06K
- There are some interesting insights after analysis and visualisation I can gain from:
 - Most users use phone service and internet service. Other service packages such as ... only fluctuate from about 20-40% of all number of users. However, for the unlimited data package, there was about 67% of users subscribed to use this monthly on average. Especially for the age group of 65 and over, the rate of using unlimited data packages accounts for more than 80%. As for students and workers, it may be because studying and working take up most of the day and offices have wifi, so the demand to use unlimited data packages is below average.
- This might lead to the average monthly charge of the age group over 65 being higher than other age groups. The age group of 65-75 and 75+ got the outstanding average monthly charge, which was around 30% higher than that of other age groups.
- Next, I would like to show you the proportion of customers by the type of contract. This is one of the most important factors that influence the churn rate. While 51% of users register month-to-month contracts occupied more than 45% of the total churn rate, the 2-year-contract customers account for only 2.55% churn rate
- Besides, there are some charts to illustrate the amount of revenue, customer distribution, and branding coverage depending on location metrics

Dashboard 2: Churned Customer
- At first glance, we can see there are 1869 customers churned and it occupied 26.54% of all users. There is no big difference between genders, the number of female churned customers is 939 while male is 930. So we can conclude that gender doesn't matter.
Now I want to focus on the offer which is the last marketing offer that the customer accepted. There will be 2 scenarios, the first is that the company didn't give them any offers at all, and the other is the offers were not interesting enough to draw their attention and hold them back.
- Secondly, the major reason that accounts for 45% of the churn rate is because of competitors. It means the competitors had better devices, better offers, or they are doing something better than us which we can't proactively adjust to adapt to customer satisfaction. Therefore we should look at other reasons. We can see more than 30% of users were not happy with our products, devices, and services. This is what we should concentrate on to decrease the churned customer.
- Finally, along with trying to retain customers, the company should also expand its branding coverage in the area because as we can see the total coverage in the western U.S. is just about 0.02%

**Conclusion and Recommendation**

 **Conclusion**
- Contract type also plays a crucial role in churn rates; month-to-month contracts show a significantly higher churn rate than longer-term contracts, indicating that customer retention is stronger with longer commitments.
- Churn analysis further highlights that gender does not influence churn rates
- The absence or inadequacy of marketing offers and strong competition account for a substantial portion of customer churn
- Competitors offering better devices or services, as well as customer dissatisfaction with products and services, are primary reasons for the high churn rate

- **Recommendation**
- Enhance Service Offerings: To reduce churn, especially among users who are dissatisfied or attracted by competitors, the company should improve its products and services. Investing in better devices, more appealing offers, and higher service quality could help retain customers.
- Targeted Marketing Strategies: Focus marketing efforts on customers with month-to-month contracts, offering incentives for longer-term commitments. This could reduce the churn rate associated with short-term contracts.
- Expand Branding Coverage: Increase branding and marketing efforts in underrepresented areas, particularly in the western U.S., to improve market presence and attract new customers.
- Personalize Offers for Older Age Groups: Given that the age group 65 and over prefers unlimited data packages and has higher average monthly charges, tailored offers that meet their specific needs could enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.
- Competitor Analysis: Conduct regular competitor analysis to understand their strengths and adjust strategies accordingly. This could include competitive pricing, better device options, or unique service features to match or exceed what competitors offer.
